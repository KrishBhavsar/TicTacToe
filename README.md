# TicTacToe

I've designed and implemented a fully functional Tic Tac Toe game using the fundamental web technologies of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This web-based application allows players to engage in the timeless two-player strategy game with a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. The HTML provides the structure and layout of the game board, while CSS is utilized for styling and creating an aesthetically pleasing design. The core game logic and interactivity are powered by JavaScript, enabling players to take turns, detect wins or draws, and enjoy a responsive and dynamic gaming experience. Whether you're a seasoned player or new to the game, this web-based Tic Tac Toe application offers endless entertainment and a chance to test your strategic skills
